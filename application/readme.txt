The files contain the code to replicate the analysis in the cTWAS paper.
Each folder contains a readme with instructions on how to run the scripts.
First, follow the instructions in the 'PredictDB' folder to prepare the weights.
Then, follow the instructions in the 'LD_matrices' folder to prepare the LD matrices, or download them directly from here (preferred): https://uchicago.box.com/s/jqocacd2fulskmhoqnasrknbt59x3xkn
The 'LDL', 'IBD', 'SBP', and 'SCZ' folders contain instructions for running the analyses for these traits and processing the results.
The 'IBD', 'SBP', and 'SCZ' analyses require running cTWAS many times and are very computationally intensive.
The 'combined' folder contains instructions for reproducing results that involve multiple traits and should be run last.
See the vignette in the ctwas package for a user-friendly introduction to reproducing the LDL analysis
